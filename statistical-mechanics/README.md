# Molecular Dynamics Simulation â€” Statistical Mechanics II Project

This project contains a basic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation of Argone written in Python, developed as the final exam in my Statistical Mechanics II course. The goal is to gain real coding experience while understand how microscopic particle interactions give rise to macroscopic thermodynamic behavior.

## ðŸ§ª Features

-  Particle initialization and random velocity assignment
-  Lennard-Jones potential 
-  Periodic boundary conditions (cubic lattice)
-  Long range correction to the energy
-  Velocity Verlet integration
-  Thermodynamic property tracking (Toal energy, Kinettc Energy, Potential Energy, Temperature)
-  Simulation Run Time

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Requirements

This script runs with Python 3 and uses the following packages:

- `numpy`
- `random`
- `matplotlib` (optional, for plotting)
- `time`

### Running the Code

```bash
python first_md_sim.py
